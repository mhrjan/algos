This repo provides examples of algorithms

You can find code for different algos in python

# Linear Search

Linear search is an algorithm where we can find element in an unsorted list.

iteration - n+1
comparision - n
 total = n+1+n = 2n+1 = O(n)

It takes time complexity of O(n)

Space complexity of n

you can run the following code by running: python3 linear.py

# Binary Search


Here the binary search is implemented in Python

The time complexity of binary search is O(logn)

where g(n) = n/2+n/2^2+n/2^3+...

n/2^k = 1

k=logn

O(logn)

# Lucky Number

A number is lucky if all digits of the number are different. How to check if a given number is lucky or not.
Examples: 
 

<pre>Input: n = 983
Output: true
All digits are different</pre>
