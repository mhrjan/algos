# 1. Longest Sub sequence

This problem states to find the longest subsequence

for example in two arrays
array1=A,B,C,D and array2=A,C,D,E,F
The subsequence can be continous or non continous. So we will take the common elements between two
we can frame sub sequence such as
AC,ACD
So the longest is ACD and the length is 3
